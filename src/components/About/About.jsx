              I am a freelance web developer. Ever since I was in high school, I
              enjoyed creating websites. My interest in web development inspired
              me to turn this passion into a career. What I most enjoy about web
              development is the ability to utilize my logical and
              problem-solving skills, while also creating interfaces for users
              that are unique and enjoyable to use. I pride myself on creating
              projects that have creative interfaces while also having concise
              and reusable code. I want both the developer and user to enjoy my
              code.

              When Iâ€™m not working you can find me running, puzzling, or reading
              the latest fantasy fiction book.

              help you!
