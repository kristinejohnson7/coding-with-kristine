    desc: "Kristine is a very smart and knowledgable person to work with. During the short time I've spent mentoring Kristine, I have seen growth and success. Our sessions are working sessions, so we were able to bounce ideas off of each other and work through some pretty complex problems using the React JS framework. I hope I get a chance to work with Kristine on a project professionally some day!",

    desc: "I mentored Kristine through a highly intensive programming course that demanded a lot of time and effort from her. I was particularly impressed with her determination to build and finish every exercise, coding challenge, and assignment given to her. Not only does she go beyond the minimum requirements to maximize her learning, but it is also very clear that she cares about the quality of her work. Iâ€™m confident Kristine will be a great addition to any software team.",

    desc: "At the risk of not being able to hire this contractor again, I'm going to be direct.  She is amazing.  Gave me 2-3x what I asked for and I asked for a lot to start with!  She provided amazing input/feedback and was very insightful.  There were hard questions, and she was able to prove what the audience was looking for based on testing assertions.  My advice to any person looking for long-term support is to hire her right away and let her help grow your business.  She is amazing and I'm already locking her in for the next couple projects I have.",
